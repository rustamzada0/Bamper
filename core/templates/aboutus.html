          <h3 class="Driver-text">Why did we need a new way to prepare drivers?</h3>
          <p class="content">For years, learners had been stuck struggling with boring handbooks and monotonous instructor talks. Classrooms full of yawning students is not an effective or safe way to learn how to drive. Low pass rates and high accident rates showed that the current system wasn't working. We needed a new system that engaged and prepared drivers in a more effective way.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="Driver-text">Eleven years ago, we created the best system for DMV knowledge exam preparation. 60 million learners later, it's guaranteed to help anyone pass.</h3>

          <p class="content-video">Driving-Tests.org is the largest independent driver education provider in the US. Driving practice tests are all we do. With 4.5M monthly visitors, we’re the ONLY specialized team dedicated entirely to driving tests: writers, researchers and analysts who know what the DMV wants from applicants and how to teach that.</p>
          <p class="content">We've partnered with state government agencies and over 2,300 libraries and organizations like NOYS, National Safety Council, Roadway Safety Foundation and Motorcycle Safety Foundation helping make our roads safer for all. Based on a nationwide survey of over 500 visitors to the DMV, aspiring learner drivers who study their state’s DMV manual and take our practice tests are 73 percent more likely to pass the knowledge test than those who study the manual alone.
